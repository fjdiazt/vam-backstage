# VaM Backstage — Implementation Documentation

## 1. What Was Built

VaM Backstage is a desktop application for managing Virt-a-Mate (VaM) `.var` packages. VaM uses ZIP-based packages containing scenes, looks, plugins, morphs, and other content. These packages form dependency trees, but VaM itself does not distinguish between packages the user chose to install and packages that exist only because something depends on them. This leads to a cluttered content browser where dependency content (morphs, plugins, clothing, etc.) pollutes the user's view.

VaM Backstage solves this by:

- **Differentiating direct installs from dependencies.** On first scan, a graph-based leaf-detection algorithm classifies packages. Users can promote/demote packages manually afterward.
- **Auto-hiding dependency content in VaM's content browser.** The app manages `.hide`/`.fav` sidecar files that VaM reads natively, making dependency content invisible in VaM without modifying any package files.
- **Providing a full package browser with Hub integration.** Users can search, browse, and install packages from the VaM Hub, with dependency resolution and concurrent downloads. A local wishlist preserves Hub snapshots for paid or removed packages.
- **Content inspector.** A flat gallery of all content items across all packages with visibility/favorite controls, custom labels, and extracted-preset provenance.
- **Package removal with dependency cascade.** Uninstalling a package identifies orphan dependencies and optionally removes them.
- **Custom labels.** User-defined colored tags on packages and individual content items, with Library/Content filters and inheritance on version upgrades.
- **Preset extraction.** Write appearance/outfit presets from scenes (and convert legacy looks) into loose VaM files under `Custom/Atom/Person/.../extracted/`.
- **Disable and offload.** Packages can be disabled in place (VaM-native: an empty `.var.disabled` marker beside the real `.var`) or offloaded to registered aux library directories on the same filesystem; disable behavior is configurable.
- **Remote client/server mode.** One machine can host the library backend over LAN WebSocket while other instances connect as thin clients (`--connect=`).

The application is built with Electron 39, React 19, SQLite (better-sqlite3), Zustand for state management, and Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui-style components (via the `shadcn` CLI and `radix-ui` primitives). It is JavaScript-only (no TypeScript). The UI is dark-only.

## 2. User Experience

### First Launch

1. The app auto-detects the VaM directory by probing common locations around the app's working directory for an `AddonPackages` folder, and counts `.var` files under it for the welcome UI. Detection internals are covered in §11.
2. A first-run wizard opens (see `FirstRun.jsx`):
   - **Beta step**: Short beta disclaimer; user continues to welcome.
   - **Welcome step**: Shows detected VaM directory, `.var` file count, "Scan library" CTA, option to change directory.
   - **Scanning step**: Weighted progress across the four local-scan phases (see §11), followed by Hub metadata enrichment and a `hub-finalize` tail.
   - **Unhandled step** (only if some `.var` files were skipped as unreadable): Summary of skipped files; user continues to setup or done.
   - **Setup step** (if at least one package was indexed): "Found X packages — Y direct, Z dependencies." Choice: "Hide dependency content" (recommended) vs "Keep everything visible."
   - **Done step**: Stats summary, "Open VaM Backstage."
3. If no packages on disk, the setup step is skipped; auto-hide is enabled by default.

### Steady-State Usage

- **Hub**: Browse VaM Hub packages with full-text search, type/pricing/author/tag/license filters, and sort options — or switch to **Wishlist** mode for a client-filtered gallery of locally saved Hub snapshots. Click a card to see a detail panel (left) with an embedded webview showing the actual Hub page (right). Install triggers download of the package plus all missing dependencies. Pin/unpin wishlist entries; when logged into the Hub, toggle favorite/bookmark/rate/like from the detail panel.
- **Library**: Browse installed packages as a gallery (compact/detailed cards) or table. Filter by label, storage state (enabled/disabled/offloaded), and update availability. Select a package to see a detail panel with content list, dependency tree, dependents, label chips, and actions (uninstall/promote/demote/disable/offload/force-remove, Link to Hub…). Context menu: apply labels, extract appearance/outfit presets from scenes, convert legacy looks. Missing dependencies section shows broken packages with install actions. Cards show a "no preset" checkmark once appearance presets have been extracted.
- **Content**: Browse all content items flat across packages as a gallery or table. Filter by label and package storage state. Select an item to see the owning package, toggle hidden/favorite, apply labels. Extracted presets show provenance ("Extracted from …") and re-extract actions. Cross-navigate to Library or Hub.
- **Downloads**: Slide-in panel (between ribbon and content area) showing active/queued/completed/failed downloads with live progress, speed, and ETA. Pause/resume all, cancel, retry.
- **Settings**: VaM directory configuration, aux offload library directories, disable behavior (suffix vs move-to-offload-dir), library rescanning, integrity verification, auto-hide toggles, thumbnail blur (privacy), remote server/client mode, update channel, developer options.
- **Status bar**: Always-visible bottom strip with package count, dependency count, content items, total size, active download progress, scan progress, remote-server indicator (when serving), and app version.

### Cross-Navigation

- Hub card → "View in Library" → Library view with that package selected
- Library detail → compass icon → Hub view with that package's detail
- Library content section → "View in gallery" → Content view filtered by that package
- Content detail → "Library" / "Hub" buttons → jump to respective view

```

### Data Flow

On startup, the main process reads SQLite and the filesystem, then builds in-memory structures (package index, dependency graph, content list, prefs map). On changes (FS watcher events, user actions, download completions), the main process writes to SQLite, rebuilds affected in-memory structures, and pushes invalidation events to the renderer, which re-fetches via IPC and re-renders.

**Read paths — in-memory vs SQLite:**

| Handler domain                   | Source of truth at read time                          |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages:*` list/detail/stats   | in-memory (via `buildFromDb()`)                       |
| `contents:*` list/counts         | in-memory                                             |
| `settings:get` / `settings:set`  | SQLite                                                |
| `downloads:list`                 | SQLite (persisted queue rows)                         |
| `thumbnails:get`                 | SQLite (paths + prefs helpers)                        |
| `hub:*`                          | Hub API + `hub_resources` / `hub_users` cache tables  |
| `labels:list`                    | in-memory label list (refreshed on label mutations)   |
| `wishlist:list` / `wishlist:ids` | SQLite `hub_wishlist` (+ install annotations at read) |

### IPC Contract

Communication between the two processes uses two patterns (arrows are elided from the diagram above):

- **Request-response**: renderer calls `ipcRenderer.invoke` (exposed as `window.api.*` by the preload script) and awaits a result from `ipcMain.handle` in main.
- **Events**: main pushes notifications via `webContents.send`, the renderer subscribes with `ipcRenderer.on`. Used for download progress, invalidation signals, and scan progress.

## 5. Design System

### Color Palette (Dark-Only)

| Token            | Hex       | Usage                    |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| `base`           | `#0a0b10` | App background           |
| `surface`        | `#111218` | Card/panel backgrounds   |
| `elevated`       | `#191a22` | Raised surfaces          |
| `hover`          | `#1f2029` | Hover states, borders    |
| `active`         | `#272833` | Active/pressed states    |
| `border-bright`  | `#2e303b` | Prominent borders        |
| `text-primary`   | `#e8e9ed` | Primary text             |
| `text-secondary` | `#82849a` | Secondary text           |
| `text-tertiary`  | `#4e5064` | Muted text, placeholders |
| `accent-blue`    | `#4a91f1` | Primary accent           |
| `accent-pink`    | `#ef5bed` | Secondary accent         |
| `accent-purple`  | `#8b5cf6` | Tertiary accent          |
| `success`        | `#34d399` | Positive states          |
| `warning`        | `#fbbf24` | Warning states           |
| `error`          | `#f87171` | Error states             |

Colors are defined as CSS custom properties in `main.css` via `@theme` and consumed through Tailwind utilities (`bg-base`, `text-text-secondary`, `border-accent-blue`, etc.).

### Content Type Colors

| Type       | Color              |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Scenes     | `#3b82f6` (blue)   |
| Looks      | `#ec4899` (pink)   |
| Clothing   | `#8b5cf6` (purple) |
| Hairstyles | `#f59e0b` (amber)  |
| Poses      | `#f97316` (orange) |
| SubScenes  | `#06b6d4` (cyan)   |

An `Other` category covers non-core package types with a neutral gray.

### Custom CSS Utilities

- `.gradient-text` — blue-to-pink text gradient via `background-clip: text`
- `.gradient-border` — blue-to-pink border using mask-composite trick
- `.btn-gradient` — gradient button (blue-to-purple) with lift on hover
- `.card-glow` — blue-tinted box-shadow on hover
- `.skeleton` — shimmer loading animation
- `.progress-bar` — animated gradient background for download bars
- `.spin-slow` — slow CSS rotation

### Procedural Gradients

Three deterministic gradient functions generate unique visual identities from string inputs:

- **`getGradient(id)`**: For packages — produces a 3-layer gradient (2 radial + 1 linear) from a deterministic string hash of `id` (e.g. filename). Each layer varies hue, saturation, and position from that hash.
- **`getContentGradient(name, type)`**: For content items — same 3-layer approach but biased toward the content type's hue, with the item name adding variation.
- **`getAuthorColor(author)`**: For author avatars — a single HSL color derived from the author name hash.

All gradients are computed client-side with no server dependency and serve as the immediate visual fallback while real thumbnails load asynchronously.

### Other Visual Details

- **Typography**: Geist Variable font (system sans-serif fallback); `user-select: none` by default for an app-chrome feel.
- **Scrollbars**: custom 6px — transparent track, `border-bright` thumb, `text-tertiary` on hover, 3px border-radius.
- **Privacy mode**: when enabled, `html[data-blur-thumbs]` triggers a strong CSS blur filter on all `.thumb` elements. Preference lives in renderer localStorage (`useRemoteUiStore`) so it stays per-machine (including remote clients) rather than in the host SQLite settings.

---

## 6. Shared Type System

Content types are defined in `src/shared/content-types.js` and shared between main and renderer processes.

### Exact Types → UI Categories

The classifier produces fine-grained "exact types" from file paths inside `.var` ZIP files. These are collapsed into user-facing categories with one of three visibility levels:

- **Visible** — shown in the Content gallery
- **Detail-only** — shown in the package detail panel but not the main Content gallery
- **Hidden** — detected and counted, never shown

| Exact Type       | UI Category | Visibility  | Path pattern                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scene`          | Scenes      | Visible     | `Saves/scene/*.json`                                     |
| `legacyScene`    | Scenes      | Visible     | `Saves/scene/*.vac`                                      |
| `subscene`       | SubScenes   | Detail-only | `Custom/SubScenes/*.json`                                |
| `look`           | Looks       | Visible     | `Custom/Atom/Person/Appearance/*.vap`                    |
| `legacyLook`     | Looks       | Visible     | `Saves/Person/Appearance/*.json`                         |
| `skinPreset`     | Looks       | Visible     | `Custom/Atom/Person/Skin/*.vap`                          |
| `pose`           | Poses       | Visible     | `Custom/Atom/Person/Pose/*.vap`                          |
| `legacyPose`     | Poses       | Visible     | `Saves/Person/Pose/*.json`                               |
| `clothingItem`   | Clothing    | Visible     | `Custom/Clothing/*` (.vab/.vaj/.vam)                     |
| `clothingPreset` | Clothing    | Visible     | `Custom/Atom/Person/Clothing/*.vap`                      |
| `hairItem`       | Hairstyles  | Visible     | `Custom/Hair/*` (.vab/.vaj/.vam)                         |
| `hairPreset`     | Hairstyles  | Visible     | `Custom/Atom/Person/Hair/*.vap`                          |
| `atomPreset`     | —           | Hidden      | other `Custom/<Category>/*.vap`                          |
| `pluginScript`   | —           | Hidden      | `Custom/Scripts/*.cs`                                    |
| `scriptList`     | —           | Hidden      | `Custom/Scripts/*.cslist`                                |
| `pluginPreset`   | —           | Hidden      | `Custom/Atom/Person/Plugins/*.vap`                       |
| `morphBinary`    | —           | Hidden      | `Custom/Atom/Person/Morphs/*.vmi`                        |
| `assetbundle`    | —           | Hidden      | `Custom/(Assets?\|Sounds?\|Audio)/`, any `*.assetbundle` |
| `audio`          | —           | Hidden      | `Custom/(Sounds?\|Audio)/*`                              |
| `texture`        | —           | Hidden      | `Custom/Atom/Person/Textures/*`                          |

### Custom Tags

Some exact types get a UI tag to distinguish them within their category:

- `legacyScene`, `legacyLook`, `legacyPose` → "Legacy" (amber)
- `skinPreset` → "Skin Preset" (sky blue)
- `clothingPreset`, `hairPreset` → "Preset" (sky blue)

### Content Deduplication

Within a single package, duplicate content items (same stem, same type) are collapsed. The highest-priority file extension wins — a clothing/hair item is defined across three companion files (`.vam` holds the metadata manifest, `.vaj` the material bindings, `.vab` the binary mesh), and picking the manifest as the canonical entry matches how VaM itself keys the item:

- For clothing/hair: `.vam` > `.vaj` > `.vab`
- For morphs: `.vmi` > `.dsf` > `.vmb` (see classifier `prefer` order)
- Clothing/hair item + preset pairs are merged (item has priority)

Cross-package deduplication also occurs: when multiple versions of the same package exist, content with the same stem and type keeps only the entry from the highest-versioned package. This prevents duplicate content items in the gallery when multiple versions coexist.

## 7. Database Schema

SQLite with WAL journaling, managed by `better-sqlite3` in the main process. Current schema version: **25**. New databases are created at the latest version in one step (`createSchema` in `db.js`); existing DBs walk forward through incremental steps in `migrate()` (v17 → … → v25). Pre-release builds at versions **< 16** cannot be upgraded — delete `backstage.db` under the app userData directory if you hit that error. The `__local__` sentinel package row that owns loose Saves/Custom content (see §7 and §11) is seeded by `ensureLocalPackage()` on every open — no schema change, just an idempotent data fixup that works on both new installs and existing DBs.

### `packages` — Package Scan Cache

One row per `.var` file on disk. If `file_mtime` + `size_bytes` match what's on disk, the ZIP is not re-read on rescan.

```sql
CREATE TABLE packages (
  filename         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- "Creator.Package.123.var"
  creator          TEXT NOT NULL,
  package_name     TEXT NOT NULL,     -- group key: "Creator.Package"
  version          TEXT NOT NULL,     -- text, not int (some versions are non-numeric)
  type             TEXT,              -- primary content category (Scenes, Looks, etc.)
  title            TEXT,              -- display name from meta.json
  description      TEXT,
  license          TEXT,              -- Creative Commons license string
  size_bytes       INTEGER NOT NULL,
  file_mtime       REAL NOT NULL,     -- fractional seconds since epoch
  is_direct        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- 1=user installed, 0=dependency

```

`missing_since` implements **soft-delete tombstones**. When a `.var` disappears from disk, neither the watcher's unlink path nor the full-scan reconciler `DELETE`s the row (which would cascade through `contents` and the label junction tables, destroying the user's identity-keyed settings). Instead they stamp `missing_since` (`markPackageMissing` / `markPackagesMissing`), which hides the row from every enumerating getter. The single filtering chokepoint is `getAllPackages()` (`… WHERE missing_since IS NULL`), which feeds `buildFromDb`/`buildGraphOnly` and therefore the in-memory `packageIndex` and everything downstream; `getAllContents` joins through it, and the remaining direct enumerators (hub scan work-lists, counts, `getAllDbFilenamesWithDir`, thumbnail work-list, donor lookup) carry the same clause. Getters that select a single row by primary key stay unfiltered — the caller already knows the identity it wants.

The payoff is **transparent restoration**: if the file reappears anywhere under a library root — a package the user moved to an unregistered folder and moved back, a restored backup, or a remounted removable drive — the row (and its hub link, labels, type override, content visibility) is still there. Any reappearance clears the stamp: `setStorageState` (relocation walk / cache-hit reconcile) and `upsertPackage` (fresh scan) both set `missing_since = NULL`. This also fixes the BrowserAssist disable/offload glitch, where BA renames the `.var` to a scratch name and back within moments — the watcher sees unlink-then-add across two debounce batches, tombstoning on the unlink and clearing it byte-for-byte on the re-add via `scanSingleVar`'s cache-hit branch, so the package never loses its identity.

Tombstones are otherwise permanent (settings tied to identity should not expire on a timer). They cost little — the DB is tiny relative to the `.var` archive it describes — but a dev-settings "Forget deleted data" button (`forgetDeletedData`, gated like "Nuke database") is the single cleanup escape hatch for anyone who wants the space back. It (1) hard-deletes every tombstone (cascading their preserved `contents`/labels) and (2) prunes **orphaned content labels**: `label_contents` rows key on `packages(filename)` rather than `contents.id`, so replacing a still-present package in place with a version that drops some items leaves the labels of those removed internal paths dangling (a rescan deletes+reinserts `contents`, which does not cascade to `label_contents`). Those orphans are likewise retained by default — consistent with the identity-keyed-memory model, so re-adding the item restores its label — and reclaimed only by this button.

`storage_state` replaces the legacy `is_enabled` boolean (v21). It encodes three physical placements:

| state                      | location                                              | content bytes live in                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`                  | main `AddonPackages` (`library_dir_id IS NULL`)       | bare `Foo.1.var`                                     |
| `disabled` (marker)        | main `AddonPackages` (`library_dir_id IS NULL`)       | bare `Foo.1.var` + empty `Foo.1.var.disabled` marker |
| `disabled` (legacy suffix) | main `AddonPackages` (`library_dir_id IS NULL`)       | `Foo.1.var.disabled` (no bare sibling)               |
| `disabled` (Qvaro rename)  | main `AddonPackages` (`library_dir_id IS NULL`)       | `Foo.1.DISABLED` (no bare sibling)                   |
| `offloaded`                | a registered aux library directory (`library_dir_id`) | bare `Foo.1.var`                                     |

For dependency-graph purposes, `disabled` and `offloaded` behave identically (the package is unavailable to VaM at runtime). Three on-disk encodings express "disabled" in main: VaM's native **marker** style keeps the real `Foo.1.var` in place beside an empty `Foo.1.var.disabled` sentinel (the marker's presence is the disable signal); the **legacy suffix** style — used by older versions of this app and some external tools — renames the content to `Foo.1.var.disabled` with no bare sibling; and the **Qvaro** style (from the Qvaro tool) renames the content to `Foo.1.DISABLED` — the whole `.var` extension replaced by `.DISABLED` (uppercase, matched case-insensitively) — again with no bare sibling. We support _reading_ all three; the legacy-suffix and Qvaro cases are identical to the classifier ("content in the disabled sibling, no bare `.var`") and differ only in the sibling's spelling. We deliberately do **not** store which encoding a row uses: the DB keeps only the canonical bare `filename`, `storage_state`, and `subpath`. Where the content bytes physically live is re-derived from disk on demand by `resolveContentPath` (`src/main/library-dirs.js`), which probes the bare + disabled-sibling sizes via `classifyMainVar` (`src/main/disable-layout.js`) for disabled rows and short-circuits to the nominal bare path for everything else; `classifyMainVarOnDisk` tries the `.var.disabled` spelling first and falls back to the `.DISABLED` rename. Reads that need the bytes are rare, one-off, and already touch the disk, so a couple of extra `stat`s cost nothing while keeping the disk the single source of truth — no cached column to go stale. App-initiated disables always produce the marker style. All app-initiated transitions go through a single `applyStorageState` chokepoint that normalizes content to the bare name, reconciles the marker, updates the DB (`storage_state`, `library_dir_id`), patches memory, and suppresses the resulting watcher events atomically. Aux dirs must live on the same filesystem as main `AddonPackages` (validated by a probe-rename when the dir is registered), so a plain rename is always sufficient. Aux dirs are always suffix-less (offloaded == active); a stray `.var.disabled` there is normalized to bare `.var` on scan/add.

A `.var` is valid anywhere under a library root, not only at the top level — VaM loads packages from any subfolder of `AddonPackages`. The `subpath` column records that relative folder (POSIX-style, `''` at the root); `pkgVarPath(pkg)` joins `library dir + subpath + filename` to the nominal bare path (writers/deleters and the companion-thumbnail lookup use this), while `resolveContentPath(pkg)` layers the on-demand disk probe on top for readers that open the archive of a possibly suffix-disabled package. `applyStorageState` preserves `subpath` across all transitions: an enabled/disabled flip renames in place inside the subfolder, and an offload mirrors the same relative subpath under the aux dir (creating it as needed), so an offload→enable round-trip is lossless. The scanner records `subpath` at discovery and reconciles it on a stat-cache hit (a same-bytes move into/out of a subfolder updates the column without re-reading the archive). The companion thumbnail (`Foo.1.jpg` next to `Foo.1.var`) is found via `dirname(pkgVarPath)`, so it tracks the package into subfolders for free.

### `library_dirs` — Offload Library Directories

Registered offload directories. Main `AddonPackages` is implicit (derived from `vam_dir`) and represented by `packages.library_dir_id IS NULL`; only aux dirs live in this table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE library_dirs (
  id         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  path       TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (unixepoch())
);
```

The scanner walks every registered library dir recursively; the watcher monitors all of them; a package moved between dirs (or into a different subfolder) by an external tool is reconciled as a move (single update of `storage_state` + `library_dir_id` + `subpath`) rather than uninstall + reinstall — so labels and other FK-bound settings survive. Removing an aux dir with no packages is a plain delete (`ON DELETE RESTRICT` guards the FK); force-removing one that still holds packages (`removeLibraryDirTombstoningPackages`) does not delete those rows — it tombstones them (see `missing_since`) and detaches `library_dir_id` so the RESTRICT lifts, leaving the on-disk `.var`s in place. Re-adding the folder and rescanning resurrects each row with its labels/overrides intact, so a force-remove is recoverable, not destructive.

### `contents` — Content Item Scan Cache

Content items discovered inside `.var` files. Avoids re-reading ZIPs on restart.

```sql
CREATE TABLE contents (
  id                INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  package_filename  TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES packages(filename) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  internal_path     TEXT NOT NULL,     -- path within the .var ZIP (or loose path for __local__)
  display_name      TEXT NOT NULL,     -- human-readable name from path
  type              TEXT NOT NULL,     -- exact type (scene, look, clothingItem, etc.)
  thumbnail_path    TEXT,              -- sibling .jpg path inside the .var ZIP (nullable)
  person_atom_ids   TEXT,              -- JSON array of Person atom ids (scene sources; v17)
  file_mtime        REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- loose-content dirty-check gate (v18)
  size_bytes        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  UNIQUE(package_filename, internal_path)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_contents_package ON contents(package_filename);
CREATE INDEX idx_contents_type ON contents(type);
```

### `labels` — User-Defined Tags (v20)

```sql
CREATE TABLE labels (
  id         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name       TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE COLLATE NOCASE,
  color      INTEGER,   -- NULL = "None" (muted); -1 = "Auto" (hash-derived); 0..N = palette index
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (unixepoch())
);

CREATE TABLE label_packages (
  label_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES labels(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  package_filename TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES packages(filename) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  PRIMARY KEY (label_id, package_filename)
);

CREATE TABLE label_contents (
  label_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES labels(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  package_filename TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES packages(filename) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  internal_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (label_id, package_filename, internal_path)
);
```

Package labels are stored on `label_packages`; content can have its own labels on `label_contents`. Junction keys use `(package_filename, internal_path)` rather than `contents.id` because content rows can be replaced during rescans. Labels on a newly installed package version are inherited from the previous version of the same group (`scanner/inherit.js`). Abandoned labels (zero applications) are garbage-collected at startup.

### `hub_wishlist` — Local Hub Wishlist (v25)

Unlike `hub_resources` (disposable API cache), this table is the feature's durable copy of detail-shaped Hub JSON — paid or removed packages may never get a local `.var` filename.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hub_wishlist (
  resource_id    TEXT PRIMARY KEY CHECK (numeric hub id),
  snapshot_json  TEXT NOT NULL,   -- raw Hub fields only; `_`-prefixed annotations stripped at write
  created_at     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (unixepoch()),
  snapshot_at    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (unixepoch()),
  unavailable_at INTEGER          -- set when Hub definitively reports the resource gone
);
```

### `downloads` — Persistent Download Queue

Survives crash/restart. Live progress (speed, %) is in-memory only. Global pause is persisted in `settings.downloads_paused`. On startup: if downloads were paused, active rows are reset to `queued` and partial `.tmp` files are kept so the queue can resume; otherwise unfinished `active`/`queued` rows are marked `'failed'` with `error='Interrupted'` (temp files cleaned up first) for manual retry.

```sql
CREATE TABLE downloads (
  id               INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  package_ref      TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- package filename or ref being downloaded
  hub_resource_id  TEXT,
  download_url     TEXT,
  file_size        INTEGER,
  priority         TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'dependency',  -- 'direct' or 'dependency'
  parent_ref       TEXT,              -- which direct install triggered this dependency
  display_name     TEXT,              -- human-readable name for UI
  status           TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'queued',  -- queued|active|completed|failed|cancelled
  temp_path        TEXT,              -- .var.tmp path during download
  error            TEXT,              -- error message if failed
  created_at       INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (unixepoch()),
  completed_at     INTEGER,
  auto_queue_deps  INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1  -- auto-queue transitive missing deps
);
```

### `hub_resources` — Hub API Response Cache

Persists full Hub resource JSON blobs so Library view can enrich dep status without network calls.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hub_resources (
  resource_id  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  hub_json     TEXT,        -- full JSON blob from Hub detail API
  search_json  TEXT,        -- cached search/list JSON for this resource
  find_json    TEXT,        -- cached find JSON for this resource
  updated_at   INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (unixepoch())
);
```

### `hub_users` — Hub User Cache

Caches Hub user metadata for author display.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hub_users (
  user_id   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  username  TEXT,
  hub_json  TEXT,           -- full JSON blob
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (unixepoch())
);
CREATE INDEX idx_hub_users_username ON hub_users(username);
```

### `settings` — Key-Value Configuration

```sql
CREATE TABLE settings (
  key   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  value TEXT
);
```

**Notable settings keys**:

- `vam_dir` — VaM installation root path
- `initial_scan_done` — `'1'` after first scan completes
- `needs_rescan` — `'1'` to force rescan on next startup (cleared after startup scan)
- `needs_prefs_migration` — `'1'` to trigger sidecar file extension migration
- `auto_hide_deps` — `'1'` to auto-manage `.hide` files for dependency content
- `auto_hide_foreign_hair` / `auto_hide_foreign_poses` / `auto_hide_foreign_clothing` — `'1'` to auto-manage `.hide` files for content of that category bundled inside packages whose own effective type is _not_ that category (e.g. hide a stray hair shipped inside a clothing pack). Looks/Scenes intentionally have no equivalent — they're commonly bundled as demos. All four auto-hide settings flow through one declarative rule table (`AUTO_HIDE_RULES` in `src/main/scanner/index.js`); each rule contributes a `matches(pkgCtx, content)` predicate. **Targeted-sweep + deference invariant**: a remove sweep for rule X unhides only items rule X claims that are currently hidden AND that no other active rule still claims; an apply sweep for rule X hides only items in rule X's claim that aren't already hidden. Rules can stack freely — overlapping claims (e.g. a hair in a dep clothing pack with both `auto_hide_deps` and `auto_hide_foreign_hair` on) stay hidden until the _last_ rule claiming them is turned off and swept.
- `hub_debug_requests` — `'1'` to log all Hub API requests
- `hub_filters_json` — cached Hub filter metadata (types, tags, sort options)
- `update_channel` — `'stable'` | `'dev'`; selects updater feed (see §23)
- `disable_behavior` — `'suffix'` (VaM-native: drop an empty `.var.disabled` marker beside the bare `.var` in main; default) or `'move-to:<auxDirId>'` (move to the named aux library directory). Removing the referenced aux dir resets this to `'suffix'`.
- `remote_mode_enabled` — `'1'` when the Settings remote section is enabled (server UI + optional auto-start).
- `remote_serve_on_launch` — `'1'` to call `remote:start` automatically on startup when remote mode is enabled.

### Local content sentinel (`__local__`)

Loose user files under `vamDir/Saves` and `vamDir/Custom` (scenes, looks, poses, presets, morphs, plugins, …) are indexed into the same `contents` table used for packaged content. Since the table requires `package_filename` to point at a real `packages` row, every install gets a synthetic sentinel row with `filename = '__local__'` (`is_direct = 1`, `storage_state = 'enabled'`, empty creator/`package_name`/`version`); loose-content rows reference it. The sentinel is filtered out of every user-visible iteration so it never appears in the Library view, facets, or stats.

Loose `.hide` / `.fav` sidecars live next to the source file (e.g. `Saves/scene/Foo/Foo.json.hide`), matching VaM's native convention; this differs from the `AddonPackagesFilePrefs/{stem}/...` layout used for packaged content. `vam-prefs.js` picks the right layout based on `packageFilename === '__local__'`.

### Migrations

Schema is forward-only. New installs go through `createSchema` directly at the latest version; existing DBs walk forward through incremental steps in `migrate()`. Any new column or table must be reflected in both `createSchema` and a new migration step — leaving them out of one will diverge new installs from upgraded ones.

| Version | Summary                                                          |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| v17     | `contents.person_atom_ids`                                       |
| v18     | `contents.file_mtime` / `size_bytes` (loose-content dirty-check) |
| v19     | `packages.hub_detail_applied_at`                                 |
| v20     | Labels tables                                                    |
| v21     | `library_dirs`, `storage_state`, drop `is_enabled`               |
| v22     | `packages.hub_name_checked_at`                                   |
| v23     | Hub-id numeric CHECK + scrub bogus `'null'` ids                  |
| v24     | `packages.subpath`                                               |
| v25     | `hub_wishlist`                                                   |
| v26     | `library_dirs.browser_assist`                                    |

## 8. In-Memory Structures

All library business logic — filtering, sorting, dependency resolution, content aggregation — runs against in-memory structures built on startup from SQLite and the filesystem. These back the `packages:*` and `contents:*` read paths; see §3 for the full read-path split.

### Core Indexes

| Structure                      | Type                                           | Description                                                |

### Stats Object

```javascript
{
  directCount,      // packages with is_direct=1
  depCount,         // packages with is_direct=0
  totalCount,       // all packages
  brokenCount,      // packages with at least one missing dependency

  directSize,       // sum of direct package sizes
  depSize,          // sum of dependency package sizes
  contentByType,    // { Scenes: N, Looks: N, ... }
  missingDepCount,  // unique missing dependency references
}
```

### Build Process

`buildFromDb({ skipGraph } = {})` is the central rebuild function:

1. Load all packages and contents from SQLite
2. If `!skipGraph`: build `groupIndex`, resolve all `forwardDeps`, compute `reverseDeps`
3. Merge `prefsMap` into content items (hidden/favorite state)
4. Deduplicate content across package versions (same stem + type → highest version wins)
5. Compute `removableSizeMap` for every package
6. Compute morph counts (own + transitive)
7. Compute orphan sets
8. Aggregate `stats`, `tagCounts`, `authorCounts`
9. Refresh label junction maps (`refreshLabels`) and extracted-preset ownership indexes

The `skipGraph` fast path is used directly by callers that know the graph is unchanged (e.g. enable/disable toggles, type overrides).

## 9. Dependency Graph

### Conceptual Model

VaM packages declare dependencies in `meta.json`. VaM Backstage resolves these into a directed acyclic graph (with cycle tolerance) connecting every installed package to the packages it requires.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["ScenePackage.1.var (direct)"] --> B[LookPackage.3.var]
    A --> C[PluginPackage.2.var]
    B --> D[MorphPack.latest]
    C --> E[HairPack.5.var]
    E --> D
    D --> F[TextureLib.1.var]

    style A fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff
    style B fill:#1e293b,color:#e8e9ed
    style C fill:#1e293b,color:#e8e9ed
    style D fill:#1e293b,color:#e8e9ed
    style E fill:#1e293b,color:#e8e9ed
    style F fill:#1e293b,color:#e8e9ed
```

The graph answers four kinds of questions:

1. **What does this package need?** (forward deps — for install/enable)
2. **What needs this package?** (reverse deps — for uninstall/disable safety)
3. **What becomes orphaned?** (removable deps — for cleanup)
4. **What is this package's role?** (leaf detection — direct vs dependency)

### Parsing

Dependency references in `meta.json` can be a dictionary (`{"Author.Pkg.123": "url"}`) or array (`["Author.Pkg.123"]`). Each ref is a string like `"Creator.Package.123"`, `"Creator.Package.latest"`, or `"Creator.Package.minN"` (at least version N). Self-references are filtered out; `.latest` / `.minN` casing is normalized. The function `parseDepRef(ref)` extracts `{creator, packageName, version, minVersion?, raw}` where `version` is numeric digits, the literal `'latest'`, or `'min'` (with `minVersion` holding the integer floor). A `.var` file on disk with a flexible version segment is never valid — only dep refs carry those tokens.

### Graph Construction

Building the full graph is a three-step pipeline that runs synchronously on the main thread:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PI[packageIndex] --> BGI[buildGroupIndex]
    BGI --> GI[groupIndex]
    PI --> BFD[buildForwardDeps]
    GI --> BFD
    BFD --> FD[forwardDeps]
    FD --> BRD[buildReverseDeps]
    BRD --> RD[reverseDeps]

    style PI fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff
    style GI fill:#8b5cf6,color:#fff
    style FD fill:#8b5cf6,color:#fff
    style RD fill:#8b5cf6,color:#fff
```

| Step                 | Input                         | Output        | Description                                                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `buildGroupIndex()`  | `packageIndex`                | `groupIndex`  | Groups filenames by `packageName` for `.latest` / `.minN` resolution |
| `buildForwardDeps()` | `packageIndex` + `groupIndex` | `forwardDeps` | Resolves each dep ref to a local filename or `missing`               |
| `buildReverseDeps()` | `forwardDeps`                 | `reverseDeps` | Inverts forward edges — for each resolved dep, records the dependent |

These three steps together are exposed as `buildGraphOnly()` — a helper called by the scanner's `graph` phase (§11) and the post-download cascade (§16) when the graph needs to be rebuilt without also recomputing the aggregates in `buildFromDb()`.

**Performance note**: The entire graph rebuild is O(P × D) where P = packages and D = average deps per package. No incremental graph patching exists — the full graph is rebuilt from scratch on any structural change. For concrete timings see §16 "Data Staleness and Consistency."

### Resolution

`resolveRef(ref, packageIndex, groupIndex)` resolves each declared dependency:

1. **Exact match** (numeric refs only — flexible refs skip this step): Look up `"Creator.Package.123.var"` or `"Creator.Package.123"` in `packageIndex`
2. **Group lookup**: Find `"Creator.Package"` in `groupIndex`, pick the highest numeric version via `pickHighestVersion()`. For `.latest` this is the expected behavior; for `.minN` the same pass runs with a floor filter (`v >= minVersion`); for versioned refs, this is a fallback.
3. Return `{resolved: filename|null, resolution: 'exact'|'latest'|'fallback'|'missing'}`

`.minN` reuses the `'latest'` machinery with a floor. When at least one local version `>= N` exists, the ref resolves to the highest such version and is reported as `'latest'`. If the group is present but no version meets the floor, the highest available is returned as `'fallback'` (amber), surfacing it in the missing-deps UI so the user can install a version that satisfies the constraint.

### Resolution States in UI

| Resolution                | Condition                                                       | UI Display             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `exact`                   | Declared version found locally                                  | "Installed" (green)    |
| `fallback`                | Different version of same group on disk (incl. below `.minN`)   | "Fallback" (amber)     |
| `latest`                  | `.latest` / satisfied `.minN` resolved to highest local version | "Installed" (green)    |
| `missing` + on Hub (free) | Not local, Hub says available + free                            | "On Hub" (blue)        |
| `missing` + unavailable   | Not local, not on Hub                                           | "Missing" (red)        |
| Downloading               | Active download for this ref                                    | Progress bar animation |
| `queued`                  | Queued for download                                             | "Queued" (pulsing)     |
| `failed`                  | Download failed                                                 | "Failed" (red)         |

### Graph Analysis Algorithms

All algorithms read from `packageIndex`, `forwardDeps`, and `reverseDeps` (built once per rebuild) and use a shared pseudocode style: `set` for unordered membership, `repeat until stable` for fixed points.

#### `getTransitiveDeps` — DFS walk

Called on demand (e.g. uninstall preview) to return the full set of reachable dependency filenames. Uses an explicit stack (`pop` from the end of the array): depth-first order, cycle-safe via a visited set. Same reachable set as BFS; only the traversal order differs.

```
getTransitiveDeps(A):
  visited = empty set
  stack = [A]
  while stack not empty:
    current = stack.pop()
    for dep in forwardDeps[current]:
      if dep.resolved and dep.resolved not in visited:
        visited.add(dep.resolved)
        stack.push(dep.resolved)
  return visited            # does NOT include A itself
```

#### `buildDepTree` — recursive DFS for UI

Produces a nested tree for the Library detail panel. Each node carries resolution status, package metadata, and children. A visited set protects against cycles — when a cycle is hit, children are returned empty.

#### `computeCascadeDisable` — fixed point

When disabling a package, also disable transitive deps that have no other enabled dependents:

```
computeCascadeDisable(target):
  toDisable = empty set
  repeat until stable:
    for dep in transitiveDeps(target):
      if dep in toDisable: skip
      if dep is already disabled: skip
      if every d in reverseDeps[dep] is either target or in toDisable:
        toDisable.add(dep)
  return toDisable
```

The loop is needed because adding a dep may unlock further deps whose only remaining enabled dependent was that dep. Convergence is guaranteed: `toDisable` only grows and is bounded by the transitive dep set.

#### `computeCascadeEnable` — single pass

Return all transitive deps of the package that are currently disabled. When re-enabling a package, its disabled deps are re-enabled unconditionally (they were presumably disabled by a prior cascade-disable).

#### `computeRemovableDeps` — fixed point

When uninstalling a package, identify which deps would become orphans:

```
computeRemovableDeps(target):
  toRemove = {target}
  repeat until stable:
    for dep in transitiveDeps(target):
      if dep in toRemove or dep.is_direct: skip
      if every d in reverseDeps[dep] is in toRemove:
        toRemove.add(dep)
  toRemove.remove(target)   # target handled separately
  return toRemove, sum(sizes)
```

Pre-computed for every package during `buildFromDb()` and cached in `removableSizeMap`, so the Library UI can show "removes X deps, frees Y MB" with no recomputation on hover.

#### `detectLeaves` — initial classification

Packages with zero reverse dependencies are "leaves" of the graph — nothing depends on them. On initial scan, leaves are classified as `is_direct = 1`; everything else starts as `is_direct = 0`.

This heuristic works because in a typical VaM library, packages the user cares about (scenes, looks) sit at the leaves while shared resources (morphs, textures, plugins) sit deeper. Users can promote/demote afterward.

#### `computeOrphanCascade` — fixed point

Identify dependency packages no direct package transitively needs:

```
computeOrphanCascade():
  directOrphans = {p for p in packageIndex if !p.is_direct and reverseDeps[p] is empty}
  toRemove = copy(directOrphans)
  repeat until stable:
    for p in packageIndex where !p.is_direct and p not in toRemove:
      if every d in reverseDeps[p] is in toRemove:
        toRemove.add(p)
  return { orphans: toRemove, directOrphans, totalSize }
```

Two sets are exposed:

- `directOrphanSet` — deps with strictly zero reverse deps (likely leftover from uninstalled packages)
- `orphanSet` — full cascade, including deps whose entire dependent chain consists of other orphans

The Library UI exposes orphans via a filter and a bulk "Remove all orphans" action.

## 10. Content Visibility — Sidecar Files

### How VaM Manages Visibility

VaM stores hidden/favorite state as empty sidecar files alongside content items:

```
{vamDir}/AddonPackagesFilePrefs/{packageStem}/{internalPath}.hide
{vamDir}/AddonPackagesFilePrefs/{packageStem}/{internalPath}.fav
```

### Architecture

- **Sidecar files are the single source of truth.** The app never caches visibility state in the database.
- **In-memory prefs map** built on startup by walking the `AddonPackagesFilePrefs` directory. Structure: `Map<"filename/internalPath", {hidden: bool, favorite: bool}>`.
- **FS watcher** monitors the prefs directory to keep the in-memory map current when VaM or the user changes flags externally.
- **IPC handlers** merge content rows with the prefs map before returning to the renderer.

### State Transitions

| Event                           | Effect                                  |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Package promoted (dep→direct)   | Delete `.hide` sidecars for all content |
| Package demoted (direct→dep)    | Create `.hide` sidecars for all content |
| User toggles hidden in app UI   | Write/delete `.hide`                    |
| User toggles favorite in app UI | Write/delete `.fav`                     |
| Package installed (direct)      | No sidecars created                     |
| Package installed (dep)         | Create `.hide` sidecars                 |
| External sidecar change         | Prefs map updates via FS watch          |

### Initial Scan Behavior

- **Existing library, user chooses "Hide dependency content"**: For each content item in dependency packages that isn't already hidden, create `.hide`.
- **Existing library, user chooses "Keep everything visible"**: No sidecars modified.
- **Empty directory**: Auto-hide enabled, nothing to process.

---

## 11. Scanner

### Scan Phases

`runScan(vamDir, onProgress)` runs on startup and on user request, emitting phases via `scan:progress` (see `scanner/index.js`):

| Phase        | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Key operations                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `indexing`   | Walk every registered library directory (main `AddonPackages/` + any registered aux dirs) recursively for `.var` files; main also accepts `.var.disabled`. Aux-dir `.var.disabled` is normalized to bare `.var` on first observation. | directory traversal                                |
| `reading`    | Per-file: skip if `file_mtime` + `size_bytes` match cache; otherwise read the ZIP, extract `meta.json`, classify and dedup content, write DB rows                                                                                     | `scanAndUpsert`                                    |
| `graph`      | Drop DB rows for files no longer on disk; on initial scan / structural changes, rebuild graph and run leaf detection                                                                                                                  | `buildGraphOnly`, `detectLeaves`, `batchSetDirect` |
| `local`      | Walk `Saves/` and `Custom/` for loose user content; classify with the same rules as packaged content; upsert under the `__local__` sentinel                                                                                           | `runLocalScan`                                     |
| `finalizing` | Optional prefs extension migration; reload prefs; rebuild in-memory state                                                                                                                                                             | `readAllPrefs`, `buildFromDb()`                    |

Hub metadata enrichment is driven separately by the first-run wizard via `wizard:enrich-hub`, which emits `hub-scan:progress` events (`lookup` / `cache` / `fetching` / `hub-finalize`). Outside first-run, enrichment is incremental and background-only.

### `.var` Reader

Uses Node.js `yauzl` to read ZIP files. Extracts:

- `meta.json` from the archive (contains name, version, creator, dependencies, description, license, etc.)
- File list from the central directory (used for content classification and thumbnail path discovery)
- On-demand file extraction for thumbnails and content inspection

### Classifier

Maps internal ZIP paths to exact types using pattern matching. Key rules:

- Path prefixes determine category (`Saves/scene/` → scene, `Custom/Clothing/` → clothing)
- File extensions determine specificity (`.vap` = preset, `.vab`/`.vaj`/`.vam` = item)
- For clothing/hair: `.vam` extension preferred (highest priority in dedup)
- Sibling `.jpg` files are noted as `thumbnail_path` on the content row

### Package Type Derivation

The package's `type` field is set to the first matching visible category found in its content, using `VISIBLE_CATEGORIES` priority order (`Scenes` > `Looks` > `Poses` > `Clothing` > `Hairstyles`). Users can override this via `type_override`.

### Integrity Checking

`verifyPackageFull(varPath)` opens the ZIP, decompresses every entry, and verifies CRC32 against the central directory. Corrupted packages are flagged with `is_corrupted=1` in the database and shown with a "Corrupted" badge in the UI.

### Local Content Scan

`runLocalScan(vamDir)` (in `scanner/local.js`) walks `Saves/` and `Custom/` recursively, builds the same `[{ path, size, mtime }]` shape the `.var` reader produces, and runs it through `classifyContents()` — so loose scenes/looks/poses/clothing/morphs/etc. light up with the same types and sibling-thumbnail logic as their packaged counterparts. Rows are written under `package_filename = '__local__'` (see §7's "Local content sentinel"). For scenes / legacy looks the scan also stores `person_atom_ids` by reading the loose JSON directly (no `SELF:/` rewrite — loose files don't use that prefix).

The loose scan is incremental in the same shape as the var scan, just at item granularity instead of package granularity. The var scanner's `(file_mtime, size_bytes)` gate on `packages` lets it skip an unchanged `.var` end-to-end — no zip open, no classify, no parse, no row writes. The loose scanner does the same with `(file_mtime, size_bytes)` on `contents`: every file is `stat`ed during the walk, and items whose stat **and** classification (display name, type, thumbnail) match the existing row are skipped entirely — no `readFile`, no parse, no DB write. Only changed/new items hit `upsertContents` (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`, preserving `contents.id`); only paths that vanished from disk hit `deleteContentsForPackagePaths`.

The classification fields are part of the gate (not just stat) so that sibling-thumbnail additions still update the row when a content file's own mtime didn't move — `classifyContents` is sibling-aware, so a scene's `thumbnail_path` can shift purely from a `.jpg` being added next to it.

`@parcel/watcher` watches `Saves/` and `Custom/` at runtime; content-file events trigger a debounced `runLocalScan`, while sibling `.hide` / `.fav` events update the in-memory `prefsMap` directly without a rescan. The watcher is also how extractor output (`Custom/Atom/Person/.../extracted/*.vap` files written by `scenes/extract.js`) gets indexed — the file event causes a debounced `runLocalScan` like any other loose-file write.

---

## 12. Download Manager

### Architecture

The download manager (`src/main/downloads/manager.js`) handles concurrent package downloads from the VaM Hub.

- **Max 5 concurrent transfers** (`MAX_CONCURRENT`)
- **Priority scheduling**: Direct installs go first, dependencies second (by `created_at` within each tier)
- **Persistent queue**: Download entries are stored in SQLite with durable state (startup recovery is described in §7's `downloads` table).
- **Live state in memory**: Progress percentage, speed, bytes loaded, and transfer handles live in-memory only. Pushed to the renderer every 250ms via `download:progress` IPC events.

### Download Lifecycle

1. **Enqueue**: `enqueueInstall(resourceId, hubDetailData, autoQueueDeps)` creates a download entry. If `autoQueueDeps`, all missing transitive dependencies are also queued.
2. **Process queue**: `processQueue()` picks the next queued item (direct priority first) and starts up to `MAX_CONCURRENT` transfers.
3. **Transfer**: Downloads to a `.var.tmp` file with resume support (HTTP Range headers). Validates the ZIP after completion (size check + integrity verification on mismatch).
4. **Integration**: `postDownloadIntegrate()` runs on success — scans/classifies the package, stores Hub metadata, optionally hides dep content, rebuilds the graph, cascade-enables disabled deps, queues newly discovered transitive deps, and fires invalidation events. See §16 "Download → Library Cascade" for the full step-by-step.

### Resume Support

If a `.tmp` file exists from a previous attempt, the manager tries a `Range: bytes=N-` request:

- `206 Partial Content`: Append to existing file
- `200 OK`: Server doesn't support Range — restart from scratch
- `416 Range Not Satisfiable`: Delete `.tmp`, restart

### Management Operations

- **Pause/Resume all**: Stops all active transfers, preserves progress state and persists pause across restarts (`settings.downloads_paused`). Resume re-queues them.
- **Cancel**: Aborts the HTTP transfer, deletes the temp file, marks `status='cancelled'`.
- **Retry**: Resets a failed download to `'queued'`.
- **Clear completed/failed**: Removes entries from the database (Downloads panel exposes Clear for both sections).

---

## 13. Hub API Client

### Endpoints

The Hub API is a single POST endpoint (`https://hub.virtamate.com/citizenx/api.php`) with an `action` parameter:

- **`getFilters()`**: Returns filter metadata (categories, tags, sort options, etc.)
- **`searchResources(params)`**: Paginated full-text search with type, pricing, author, tag, license, and sort filters
- **`getResourceDetail(resourceId)`**: Full resource detail including `hubFiles` array (one entry per `.var` version)
- **`getResourceDetailByName(packageName)`**: Lookup by package group name
- **`findPackages(refs)`**: Batch lookup of package references — returns `{ref: hubFileData}` for available packages

### Caching

- **In-memory LRU caches**: `searches` (500 entries), `details` (1000 entries), `filters` (singleton)
- **Database cache**: `hub_resources` and `hub_users` tables persist across sessions
- **CDN index**: `https://s3cdn.virtamate.com/data/packages.json` maps filenames to resource IDs. Used for update checking without individual API calls.

### Hub-Local Cross-Referencing

When search results return from the Hub, the client enriches each resource with local install status (`_installed`, `_isDirect`, `_localFilename`). It also backfills `hub_display_name` and `hub_user_id` into the packages database as a side effect of browsing.

### Hub account interactions

`hub/interactions.js` manages Hub session cookies and authenticated actions (favorite, bookmark, rate, like). `hub:isLoggedIn` probes cookie presence; `hub:resourceUserState` reads per-resource state. Toggle handlers return `{ ok, reason? }` and emit `hub:auth-changed` when the session is invalid. These channels stay **local-only** in remote client mode (not proxied over WebSocket) because the session lives in the local Electron partition.

### Wishlist maintenance

Background Hub fetches (`getResourceDetail`, `scanHubDetails`, name lookup) piggyback wishlist snapshot refresh via `upsertHubResourceDetail` / `markWishlistItemUnavailable` in `db.js`. When a row changes, the hub client emits bare `wishlist:updated` so an already-loaded wishlist refreshes. User pin/unpin via `wishlist:add` / `wishlist:remove` calls `notifyPeers('wishlist:updated', { membership: true })` so other connected clients refresh pins/count without echoing the event back to the actor (who already updated optimistically and reloads after the RPC). The membership marker preserves the old standalone behavior: background Hub traffic does not re-fetch wishlist IDs when the full list has never been loaded. Adding also fire-and-forgets `prefetchHubResThumbnail` so icons survive later Hub removal.

---

## 14. File System Watcher

### Subscriptions

The watcher (`src/main/watcher.js`) runs three sets of `@parcel/watcher` subscriptions, one per concern:

1. **packageWatcher** — one subscription per registered library directory (main `AddonPackages/` plus any registered aux/offload dirs), each recursive so `.var` files in subfolders are seen. Watches for `.var` and (in main only) `.var.disabled` files. Restarts whenever the `library_dirs` registry changes. On an unlink, the canonical is located by a single recursive walk across the library dirs (`locateVars`) before any delete, so a file moved to another dir or subfolder is reconciled as a single `setStorageState` UPDATE (state + `library_dir_id` + `subpath`), preserving package rows and their label FKs; only a truly-gone file is deleted.
2. **localWatcher** — one subscription per loose-content root (`Saves/`, `Custom/`) for content changes (debounced `runLocalScan`) and sibling `.hide`/`.fav` sidecars.
3. **prefsWatcher** — single subscription on `AddonPackagesFilePrefs/` for `.hide`/`.fav` sidecar changes.

`@parcel/watcher` is recursive natively (one kernel handle per root, regardless of file count) — no per-file `fs.watch` handle, no userspace catalog walk on resume. Symlinks are not followed by default, so the BrowserAssist symlink-farm problem doesn't apply.

### Event Processing

Events are debounced for 500ms and processed as a batch:

**Package events** (add/change/unlink):

- For non-unlink events, run through `awaitStable` (`var-stability.js`) — calls `verifyZipFile` (yauzl-based EOCD + CD parse) for an immediate-pass on atomic-rename writers, falls back to stat-stability polling (300ms tick, 2000ms quiet window, 60s cap) for streaming downloads.
- Detect `.var` ↔ `.var.disabled` renames and cross-dir moves → call `setStorageState()` instead of add/remove
- New/changed files: `scanAndUpsert()` reads the ZIP and updates the database
- Removed files: Delete from database (CASCADE removes content rows)
- After all changes: `buildFromDb()` to rebuild in-memory structures
- Apply auto-hide rules to freshly-scanned packages via `computeAutoHidePathsForNewPackage` + `hidePackageContent` — same flow as `postDownloadIntegrate`, ensures externally-dropped `.var`s honor the foreign-hair / poses / clothing rules. Watcher-installed files are treated as `is_direct=1`, so the `deps` rule doesn't fire here.
- **No cascade on external changes.** Enabling a package on disk (dropping its `.var`, or a peer app removing a `.var.disabled` marker) never cascade-enables its disabled/offloaded deps, and disabling never cascade-disables dependents. A watcher event is an unattended external change: silently flipping _other_ packages would race a peer app's own queued dep changes, enable content the user may not want, and be a surprising side effect. Unsatisfied deps simply show as "broken" in the graph. Cascade only happens on app/user-initiated transitions (`ipc/packages.js` toggle-enabled, `postDownloadIntegrate`). Freshly-scanned enabled packages are still Hub-enriched (metadata only, no state change).
- Emit `packages:updated`, `contents:updated`

**Prefs events** (sidecar add/remove):

- Update `prefsMap` in memory

### Bulk Window

When the app itself does a coordinated bulk of writes (toggle-enabled across hundreds of packages, postDownloadIntegrate writing many sidecars, etc.), it wraps the operation in `withBulkWindow(async (ourPaths) => …)`. While the window is open:

- All FS events from every subscription are buffered instead of dispatched.
- Each app-initiated path is registered via `recordOwnedPath(p)` (which `applyStorageState`, `setHidden`, `unlinkPackagePhysicalAndAliases`, etc. call internally).
- When the window closes, buffered events whose path is in `ourPaths` are dropped; all other events flow into the normal pending-event maps.

Outside a bulk window, `recordOwnedPath` is a no-op. Single non-bulk writes (e.g. one sidecar toggle) accept the resulting watcher event, which is harmless because `scanSingleVar` short-circuits on unchanged (mtime, size) and prefs handling is idempotent.

This replaces the previous TTL-based `suppressPath`/`suppressPrefsStem` mechanism — which had to coordinate against chokidar's per-file `fs.watch` rebuild on resume and its `awaitWriteFinish` stat-polling. With parcel there's no per-file polling and no catalog walk, so the watcher can stay live during the bulk and the entire suppression surface collapses to "buffer + filter" with no race or TTL.

## 15. Thumbnails and Avatars

### Thumbnail Sources

1. **Content thumbnails**: Sibling `.jpg` files inside the `.var` ZIP (discovered during scan, stored as `thumbnail_path` on the content row). Extracted on demand.
2. **Package thumbnails**: Hub CDN images via `image_url` on the package row. Resolved by `thumb-resolver.js`: packages with `image_url IS NULL` get `hub_resource_id` backfilled from the **`packages.json` CDN index** when missing, then icons are fetched from the **resource-icons CDN** (`1424104733.rsc.cdn77.org`, see `thumb-resolver.js`) — not via the Hub `findPackages()` API.
3. **Fallback**: Procedural gradient rendered immediately — real image overlaid when loaded.

### Thumbnail Pipeline

**Main process**:

- On-demand extraction from `.var` ZIPs via IPC, disk-cached in `{userData}/thumb-cache/`
- Two cache-file schemes: `hub-icon-{rid}.jpg` (Hub CDN icon, keyed by resource id, shared by installed packages and wishlist cards) and `{filename}__{hash}.jpg` (thumb extracted from a `.var`, keyed by file + internal path; a package's own thumb reuses its representative content entry)
- Background batch resolution (`thumb-resolver.js`) downloads Hub icons for packages without one; a one-time `thumb-cache-migrate.js` pass upgrades the pre-unification `{filename}.jpg` layout

**Renderer**:

- `useThumbnail(key)` hook: Returns blob URL or null. Uses a shared `createBlobCacheHook()` factory for caching blob URLs.
- Cards always render the gradient background; overlay `<img>` when the thumbnail arrives.

### Avatar Pipeline

- `useAvatar(userId)` hook fetches Hub user avatar images
- Cached locally in `{userData}/avatar-cache/`
- `AuthorAvatar` component shows the avatar if available, otherwise a colored box with initials from `getAuthorColor(author)` and `getAuthorInitials(author)`

## 16. State Management and Main↔Renderer Synchronization

All renderer state is managed by **Zustand** stores (no Redux, no Context providers). Each store is a standalone hook. State synchronization between the main process and renderer follows a **push-invalidation + pull-data** pattern: the main process pushes lightweight event notifications, and the renderer re-fetches full datasets in response.

### Store Overview

| Store               | Purpose                            | Key State                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useLibraryStore`   | Local packages, filters, detail    | `packages[]`, filter state, `selectedDetail`, `viewMode`, `selectedLabelIds`, `missingDeps`, `updateCheckResults` |
| `useContentStore`   | Content items, filters, detail     | `contents[]`, filter state, `selectedItem`, `selectedPackage`, `selectedLabelIds`, `viewMode`, `expandedByType`   |
| `useHubStore`       | Hub search, filters, detail        | `resources[]`, filter state, `detailData`, `cardMode`, `galleryMode` (`hub` \| `wishlist`), `filterOptions`       |
| `useDownloadStore`  | Download queue and live progress   | `items[]`, `liveProgress{}`, `paused`, lookup maps by resource ID and package ref                                 |
| `useInstalledStore` | Lightweight install status cache   | `byHubResourceId` map for Hub UI cross-referencing                                                                |
| `useLabelsStore`    | Label definitions + counts         | `labels[]`, `byId`, `fetchLabels()` on `labels:updated`                                                           |
| `useWishlistStore`  | Local Hub wishlist                 | `items[]`, `ids` Set, `load()` / `toggle()` backed by SQLite snapshots                                            |
| `useViewStore`      | Active ribbon view (persisted)     | `view`: `'hub'` \| `'library'` \| `'content'` — Settings/Downloads never restored as the launch view              |
| `useRemoteUiStore`  | Local-only UI state (persisted)    | `warningDismissed` (client-mode security banner); `blurThumbnails` (privacy blur) — both localStorage, not SQLite |
| `useStatusStore`    | Status bar stats and scan progress | `stats{}`, `scan{}`                                                                                               |
| `useToastStore`     | Notification toasts                | `toasts[]`, `add()`, `dismiss()`                                                                                  |

### Shared Patterns

**Type filter slice** (`typeFilterSlice.js`): A reusable Zustand slice providing `selectedTypes[]`, `toggleType(type)`, and `selectSingleType(type)` — shared between Library and Content stores.

**Nonce-based stale response protection**: Several stores use an incrementing `nonce` counter for async operations (missing deps, hub availability, hub search). Each fetch increments the nonce before the async call; when the response returns, it's discarded if the nonce no longer matches. This prevents stale responses from overwriting newer data.

### Synchronization Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main Process
    participant R as Renderer

    Note over M: Mutation happens
    M->>M: DB write + buildFromDb

    M--)R: packages:updated
    M--)R: contents:updated
    M--)R: downloads:updated
    Note over M,R: Invalidation events carry no payload

    R->>M: packages:list
    M-->>R: packages array
    R->>M: packages:stats
    M-->>R: stats object
    R->>M: downloads:list
    M-->>R: downloads array
    Note over R: Re-fetches authoritative data

    loop Every 250ms per transfer
        M--)R: download:progress + payload
    end
    loop During scan
        M--)R: scan:progress + payload
    end
    Note over M,R: Streaming events carry data directly
```

The events split into two categories:

- **Invalidation events** (`packages:updated`, `contents:updated`, `labels:updated`, `wishlist:updated`, `downloads:updated`): Usually carry no payload and signal "something changed" so the renderer re-fetches authoritative state via `ipcMain.handle`. Peer pin/unpin adds `{ membership: true }` to `wishlist:updated` only to select the cheap ID refresh when the full wishlist is not loaded.
- **Streaming events** (`download:progress`, `scan:progress`): Carry data payloads directly. Used for high-frequency updates where a full re-fetch would be too expensive. The renderer writes these directly into Zustand state with no IPC round-trip.

### Event Reactions by View

Each event triggers a specific set of re-fetches per subscriber. Hub search/filter state lives in `useHubStore`, but `HubView` also listens for `packages:updated` (install-badge + wishlist reconciliation) and `wishlist:updated` (peer pin/unpin and background snapshot refreshes).

Notes on LibraryView's `packages:updated` handling:

- Missing-dep data is re-fetched eagerly when the "missing" filter is active, or invalidated (set to `null`) otherwise so the next filter activation triggers a lazy fetch.
- `checkForUpdates()` re-runs the CDN update check against the rebuilt package list.

Notes on DownloadStore:

- `download:progress` is a pure in-memory update driven by the event payload — no IPC round-trip.
- `downloads:pause-changed` is emitted with `notifyPeers` only for pause/resume/cancel-all. The actor remains optimistic; peers set the boolean directly. Ordinary standalone `downloads:updated` handling remains unchanged and performs no extra pause query or pruning.

### Cross-Store Synchronization

#### Hub ↔ Installed Status

The Hub view needs to show install/badge status on every card. Rather than re-querying the main process for each card, a lightweight `useInstalledStore` cache maps `hub_resource_id → {installed, isDirect, filename}`.

This cache is populated from two sources:

1. **Hub search results**: When `fetchResources()` returns, each resource carries `_installed`, `_isDirect`, `_localFilename` (enriched by the main-process IPC handler). The Hub store calls `syncInstalledFromResources()` which batch-updates the installed store.
2. **Hub detail views**: When `openDetail()` or `refreshDetail()` returns, `syncInstalledFromDetail()` updates the installed store for that single resource.

The `useHubInstallState(rid)` hook composes three data sources to produce a discriminated state for Hub action buttons:

```
useHubInstallState(rid):
  installStatus ← useInstalledStore (installed? isDirect?)
  dlInfo        ← useDownloadStore (active download? progress?)
  mainDlStatus  ← useDownloadStore (queued/active/failed?)
  pendingInstall← useDownloadStore (clicked but not yet queued?)

  if dlInfo.active         → 'downloading'   (show progress bar)
  if pendingInstall        → 'queued'         (show spinner)
  if installed && isDirect → 'installed'      (show "Installed" badge)
  if installed             → 'installed-dep'  (show "Add to Library" button)
  if isExternal            → 'external'       (show external link)
  if mainDlStatus=failed   → 'failed'         (show "Retry")
  else                     → 'install'        (show "Install" button)
```

#### Download → Library Cascade

When a download completes, the main process runs `postDownloadIntegrate()`, which triggers a chain of state updates:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    DL[Download completes] --> SCAN[scanAndUpsert]
    SCAN --> HUB[setHubDisplayName]
    HUB --> HIDE{any auto-hide rule applies?}
    HIDE -- yes --> SIDECAR[hidePackageContent]
    HIDE -- no --> GRAPH
    SIDECAR --> PREFS[readAllPrefs + setPrefsMap]
    PREFS --> GRAPH[buildGraphOnly]
    GRAPH --> CASCADE[computeCascadeEnable]
    CASCADE --> RENAME[rename .var.disabled → .var]
    RENAME --> QDEPS{autoQueueDeps?}
    QDEPS -- yes --> FIND[findPackages on Hub]
    FIND --> INSERT[insertDownload + processQueue]
    INSERT --> REBUILD
    QDEPS -- no --> REBUILD["buildFromDb(skipGraph)"]
    REBUILD --> NOTIFY[notify packages + contents updated]
    NOTIFY --> THUMB[resolvePackageThumbnails]

    style DL fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff
    style NOTIFY fill:#8b5cf6,color:#fff
```

Each step in the chain:

#### Optimistic UI for Downloads

The download store uses `pendingInstalls` (a `Set<hubResourceId>`) for optimistic UI. When the user clicks "Install":

1. `rid` is added to `pendingInstalls` immediately (synchronous, no IPC)
2. The IPC call `packages:install` is made (async)
3. On completion (success or failure): `fetchItems()` re-fetches the download list, then `rid` is removed from `pendingInstalls`

This allows the Hub card to show "Queued" state instantly, before the main process has even created the download DB row. The `useHubInstallState` hook checks `pendingInstalls` second in priority, so it covers the gap between click and queue creation.

#### Download Store Indexes

The download store builds two lookup maps on every `fetchItems()`:

- `byHubResourceId: Map<rid, downloadRow>` — for Hub cards to check if their resource is downloading
- `byPackageRef: Map<ref, downloadRow>` — for Library dep rows to check if a missing dep is queued/active. Also indexes by stem (without `.var`) so dep refs match download entries.

Both indexes skip cancelled downloads and take the first match (oldest) for deduplication.

### Mutation Flow Examples

#### Package Uninstall (with dependents)

```
User clicks "Uninstall" on package A (which has dependents)
  │
  Renderer: packages:uninstall IPC call
  │
  Main process:
  ├─ Check reverseDeps[A] → has dependents → demote, don't delete
  ├─ setPackageDirect(A, false)     ── DB: is_direct = 0
  ├─ hidePackageContent(A, paths)   ── disk: create .hide sidecars
  ├─ readAllPrefs() → setPrefsMap() ── in-mem: reload full prefs
  ├─ buildFromDb(skipGraph: true)   ── in-mem: rebuild (graph unchanged)
  ├─ notify('packages:updated')
  └─ notify('contents:updated')
  │
  Renderer reacts:
  ├─ LibraryView: re-fetches packages, refreshes detail panel
  ├─ ContentView: re-fetches contents (hidden states changed)
  └─ StatusBar: re-fetches stats (direct count decreased)
```

#### Package Toggle Enabled/Disabled

```
User clicks "Disable" on package A
  │
  Main process:
  ├─ Compute cascadeDisable(A) → {B, C}
  ├─ For each target: nextStorageStateForIntent(current, 'disable', disableTarget)
  │     disableTarget ← parseDisableBehavior(settings.disable_behavior)
  │       'suffix'  → storage_state='disabled' in main (empty .var.disabled marker beside bare .var)
  │       'move-to:<id>' → storage_state='offloaded' in aux dir (bare .var)
  ├─ applyStorageState for A, B, C  (single chokepoint: fs.rename + DB + watcher suppression)
  ├─ In-mem: patchStorageState([A, B, C], …)
  ├─ notify('packages:updated')
  └─ Return {ok, storageState, cascadeCount}
  │
  Renderer: fetchPackages → relink content package refs → toast with cascade count
```

Re-enable inverts the matrix (`intent: 'enable'`) — an offloaded package returns to main `enabled`; a suffix-disabled package drops the `.disabled` suffix.

### Data Staleness and Consistency

The system accepts bounded staleness in exchange for responsiveness:

- **Renderer data lags by one IPC round-trip** after a mutation. Between `notify()` and the renderer's `fetchPackages()` completing, the UI shows stale data — typically <50ms and imperceptible.
- **Fast-path patches** (`patchStorageState`, `patchTypeOverride`) mutate the in-memory `packageIndex` directly. Derived aggregates (stats, orphan sets) may be stale until the next `buildFromDb()`; full rebuilds run on any structural change. Content rows are not touched: the renderer joins package fields onto content via `c.package` references rebuilt by `useContentStore.relink()` after each `fetchPackages`, so package mutations propagate to content UI without a `contents:list` IPC.
- **The graph is never incrementally patched** — it's rebuilt from scratch on every structural change. This keeps graph code simple at the cost of O(P × D) per change (<100ms for typical libraries of <5000 packages).
- **Concurrent mutations are serialized** by Node.js's single-threaded event loop; two IPC handlers cannot interleave reads and writes to in-memory structures.

For the in-memory vs SQLite split, see §3.

## 17. Performance

The library scales from a few hundred packages on a fresh install to 50k+ on heavy users. The cost model is dominated by the filesystem: every startup walks `AddonPackages/` (~1700 `.var` files), `AddonPackagesFilePrefs/` (~27k stem subdirs of `.hide`/`.fav` sidecars), and `Saves/` + `Custom/` (loose user content). Network and CPU are secondary.

### Pool-disjoint principle

Three resource pools that don't compete with each other:

- **CPU / event loop** — manifest parsing, JSON, SQLite ops
- **libuv FS pool** (default 4 workers, `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE`) — every walker, every `readdir` / `stat`, plus the stat-stability fallback in `awaitStable`. (`@parcel/watcher` itself runs on its own native thread pool, not libuv.)
- **Network** — Hub API, CDN

The architectural goal is "**one consumer per pool at a time, branches across pools concurrent**" — _not_ "parallelize everything". Two FS walkers fighting over the libuv pool drag startup from sub-second into the tens of seconds because per-stat latency collapses under queue contention.

Cross-pool concurrency is free and should always be used. The FS chain (`runScan` → `runLocalScan` → `readAllPrefs`) and the network chain (`fetchPackagesJson` → `scanHubDetails` → `resolvePackageThumbnails`) run as parallel branches in `startupScan`. Within the FS chain, phases run sequentially; within a phase, parallelize via a single shared `pLimit`.

### Per-content vs per-var rule

Two cardinalities matter:

- **~1 700** `.var` files — per-var loops are cheap, can afford O(packages) IPC events, JSON parses, and DB statements at startup.
- **~100 000+** content items, prefs sidecars, loose files — per-content loops can't.

Per-content paths must:

1. **Be cache-gated.** Don't re-do work that hasn't changed. Existing examples: `scanAndUpsert` skips `.var` open if `(file_mtime, size_bytes)` matches the cached `packages` row; `runLocalScan` skips re-classify + upsert if `(file_mtime, size_bytes)` _and_ classification fields all match the cached `contents` row; `walkForVars` collects dirents first and only `stat`s `.var` candidates, never every entry.
2. **Batch DB writes.** Use prepared statements inside a transaction; per-row `INSERT` outside a transaction is ~100× slower at 100k items. `upsertContents` and `batchSetDirect` are the canonical shapes.
3. **Never emit one IPC event per content item.** Renderer status bars can't display per-row anyway. Stride per-row progress (e.g. `scanHubDetails`'s `LOOKUP_PROGRESS_STRIDE = 50`) or skip per-item progress entirely; the renderer only needs phase-granular signals. `fetchPackages` in `useLibraryStore` coalesces concurrent refetches for the same reason — startup fires `packages:updated` multiple times in quick succession, and serializing 1700 rows through IPC per event is wasted work.

### Dirty-check pattern

When restoring "we already applied this cached data" state across launches:

1. Store a per-row `_applied_at INTEGER` column mirroring the source's `_updated_at`.
2. Bump source markers only on _real_ content change — guard `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` with `WHERE existing IS NOT excluded.…` so re-fetches that return identical bytes don't cascade into spurious re-applies.
3. The work-list on each launch is the SQL join "**applied < updated**" — usually zero rows on warm steady state.

The existing `packages.file_mtime` / `size_bytes` cache gate on `.var` re-reads is one instance of this pattern (source = on-disk file, applied = cached row), and `contents.file_mtime` / `size_bytes` is the same gate at item granularity for loose content. The same shape applies to mirroring database-resident sources too — for example, restoring cached `hub_resources` enrichment onto `packages` rows on every launch should walk a `WHERE applied_at < updated_at` work-list rather than every row unconditionally. The architectural payoff is that warm steady state hits zero rows: no JSON parses, no DB writes, no IPC events. Cold starts and source-data bumps walk only the rows that actually changed.

### `pLimit(8)` shape

The default libuv pool has 4 workers (`UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE`). All walks use a shared `pLimit` with concurrency **8** — 2× headroom for transient bursts without padding the queue past usefulness. Two non-negotiable rules:

- **The limiter must be call-scoped, not recursive.** A per-directory `pLimit(8)` compounds: every directory spawns up to 8 stats _plus_ up to 8 sub-walks, each spawning its own 8 — the pool is blown in milliseconds. One limiter per top-level call, shared across the entire recursion.
- **Two-pass collect-then-act.** Cheap recursive `readdir` traversal first (single-threaded, O(dirs) syscalls), gathering candidate paths into an array. Then `Promise.all` over `candidates.map(c => limit(act))` for the expensive operation. This isolates the parallelism boundary. `walkForVars`, `runLocalScan`'s walk, and `readAllPrefs` all follow this shape.

Concurrent walkers across phases remain forbidden — two phases each running their own `pLimit(8)` against a 4-worker pool is effectively `pLimit(16)` against 4 workers, which is back to fighting.

### Symlinks: never followed

`@parcel/watcher` does not follow symlinks recursively (kernel-side watching via `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on Windows / FSEvents on macOS sees the link itself, not its target). Our own walks (`walkForVars`, `runLocalScan`'s walk, `readAllPrefs.walkSidecarDir`) explicitly skip `entry.isSymbolicLink()` for the same reason — some user-installed plugins (JayJayWon's BrowserAssist) drop directory symlinks under `Saves/` pointing back at `AddonPackages`, `AddonPackagesFilePrefs`, etc., and following them would have us enumerate the entire 60k+ FilePrefs tree from the local-content path.

## 18. Reusable Components

### VirtualGrid

Built on **@tanstack/react-virtual**; used by Library and Content galleries (and, as a virtual list with fixed row heights, by their table views).

- Responsive column count based on available width and `itemWidth` prop
- Row-based virtualization (items grouped into rows)
- Maintains scroll position anchor across layout changes
- Respects `scrollResetKey` to reset scroll position on filter changes
- Reports layout metrics via `onLayout` callback (`{ cols, cellWidth, availableWidth }`)
- Configurable `gap`, `padding`, `overscan`

The Library gallery uses a default `itemWidth` of 220px (user-adjustable, persisted); the Content gallery defaults to the same but is driven by a thumbnail-size slider.

### FilterPanel

A generic, resizable filter sidebar used by all three main views. Supports these section types:

| Section Type          | Behavior                                                                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list`                | Single-select buttons with optional icons and color indicators          |
| `tags`                | Multi-select with color dot badges and toggle checkboxes                |
| `text`                | Simple text input with clear button                                     |
| `text-autocomplete`   | Text input with dropdown suggestions (substring match, sorted by count) |
| `tags-autocomplete`   | Multi-select tags with dropdown suggestions                             |
| `labels-autocomplete` | Multi-select labels with colored chips + inline manage/rename menu      |
| `select`              | Dropdown select                                                         |

Features: resizable width (persisted to localStorage), global search bar at top, collapsible lists (>6 items with "Show more" toggle).

### ResizeHandle

A 4px invisible strip that enables panel resizing. Side-aware delta calculation, `col-resize` cursor during drag, subtle hover/active visual feedback.

### PackageCard Variants

A single `PackageCard.jsx` file exports multiple card components:

- **`HubCard`**: Gallery card for Hub resources (minimal/medium modes, state-dependent action buttons)
- **`LibraryCard`**: Local package card (thumbnail, metadata, status badges)
- **`LibraryTableRow`**: Table row variant of library card
- **`ContentCard`**: Square content item card (type badge, custom tag, hover-reveal controls)
- **`LabelDots` / `LabelChip`**: Colored label indicators on cards; package labels inherit visually to content
- **`DepRow`**: Dependency tree row with nested indentation and status tags
- **`AuthorAvatar`**: Hub avatar or colored-initial fallback
- **`AuthorLink`**: Clickable author name dispatching filter actions

### LicenseTag

Renders Creative Commons license abbreviations with a colored badge. License canonicalization and commercial-use detection are shared utilities.

### ContentCategory

Expandable/collapsible content type groups with batch hide/favorite toggle actions on the category header.

### ScrollToTopButton

Floating control mounted by `VirtualGrid` when the scroll container is far from the top.

### StorageStateChip

Badge showing `enabled` / `disabled` / `offloaded` on package detail panels.

## 19. IPC Channel Reference

Handlers live under `src/main/ipc/` split per domain (`packages.js`, `contents.js`, `hub.js`, `downloads.js`, `scanner.js`, `settings.js`, `thumbnails.js`, `avatars.js`, `shell.js`, `dev.js`, `labels.js`, `wishlist.js`, `library-dirs.js`, `extract.js`, `remote.js`, plus app handlers in `index.js`) and `updater:*` handlers in `src/main/updater.js`. The preload script (`src/preload/index.js`) exposes them on `window.api`; in client mode (`--connect=`) the same surface is tunneled over WebSocket via `remote-transport.js`.

### Naming conventions

- `<domain>:<verb>` — request-response (`ipcMain.handle` / `ipcRenderer.invoke`). Read verbs: `list`, `detail`, `stats`, `*-counts`. Mutation verbs: `install`, `uninstall`, `promote`, `toggle-*`, `set-*`, `remove-*`, `force-remove`, `retry`, `cancel`, `clear-*`.
- `<domain>:updated` — payload-less invalidation events (see §16).
- `<domain>:progress` — streaming events carrying data directly.
- `wizard:*` — first-run wizard flow.
- `startup:*` — one-shot startup handoffs.

#### Dev (`src/main/ipc/dev.js`)

Always registered, but destructive handlers (`dev:nuke-database`) are gated behind either `is.dev` or the `developer_options_unlocked` setting (toggled by seven taps on the version string).

When developer options are unlocked, **F12** (and Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Alt+I) toggle Chromium DevTools on the main window — the hotkeys are gated in `attachDevToolsHotkeys` (`src/main/index.js`) so they work in packaged builds, not just `npm run dev`. All main-process `console.*` output is also mirrored into the renderer DevTools console with a `[main]` prefix via `src/main/log-forward.js` and a preload-side `main:log` listener; messages emitted before the renderer finishes loading are buffered (last 500) and flushed on `did-finish-load`.

## 21. Preset Extraction

Scenes and legacy looks share VaM's `{ atoms: [{ type: "Person", storables }] }` JSON shape. `scenes/extract.js` reads that JSON (from inside a `.var` or loose on disk), filters storable entries, and writes `.vap` (+ optional `.jpg`) presets under:

```
{vamDir}/Custom/Atom/Person/Appearance/extracted/Preset_<creator> - <name>.vap
{vamDir}/Custom/Atom/Person/Clothing/extracted/Preset_<creator> - <name>.vap   (outfit)
```

**Probe path**: At scan time, scene-source rows store `person_atom_ids` (v17). During `buildFromDb()`, `extractedAppearanceBasenames` collects basenames of loose `look` rows under `Appearance/extracted/`; package cards compare scene rows against that set for the "no preset" / checkmark UI.

**Write path**: Context menus in `LibraryPackageContextMenu` and `ContentItemContextMenu` call `extract:run` (single/batch) or `extract:run-for-packages` (bulk selection). Modes: `create` (skip existing), `overwrite`, `refresh`. After any write, `refreshAfterExtract()` runs `runLocalScan` + `buildFromDb()` + `packages:updated` so library cards flip immediately (the watcher emits `contents:updated` after its debounce).

**Extracted preset lifecycle**: Loose presets are `__local__` content rows attributed to an owning package via `extractedFrom` / `extractedByPackage`. They appear in Content with an "Extracted" tag and inherit the owner's storage state. Disable/delete of extracted `.vap` files uses `scenes/extracted-lifecycle.js` rename/unlink plans (`.disabled` suffix + sidecar carry).

## 22. Remote Client/Server Mode

One Electron instance can host the full main-process backend on the LAN while others connect as thin clients.

**Server** (`remote/server.js`): A `ws` listener on `0.0.0.0` (default port `42069`, see `shared/remote-config.js`). `remote/registry.js` captures every `ipcMain.handle` registration into a lookup map; incoming `{ channel, args }` frames invoke the same handlers locally unless denied by `remote/channel-policy.js` (`shell:*`, `remote:*`, `updater:*`, `dev:*`, native browse/detect, Hub session toggles, database-path disclosure). `notify()` events are rebroadcast to all connected clients except machine-local channels (`hub:auth-changed`, `updater:*`). `notifyPeers()` skips the invoking renderer or WebSocket when the actor is already current. No authentication — trusted-LAN assumption. Version mismatch is rejected unless the peer runs in dev/unlocked-developer mode.

**Client** (`preload/remote-transport.js`): When launched with `--connect=<ws://host:port>`, all `window.api.*` invokes become WebSocket RPC; event subscriptions receive rebroadcast payloads. `remote:*`, `shell:openExternal`, updater, and Hub session channels still use local IPC (or stubs); the server denylist is the backstop against raw peers bypassing that routing.

**Settings UX**: Enable remote mode, optional serve-on-launch, pick port, copy `ws://<ip>:<port>`. Connecting/disconnecting relaunches the app with/without `--connect=` (hot-switching transport mid-session is intentionally not supported). Client autoconnect URL is stored in a standalone file (`remote/autostart.js`) because a pure client head may have no DB yet.

## 23. Release Channels

Two GitHub Actions workflows publish to separate channels. The in-app setting `update_channel` (`stable` | `dev`, default `stable`) picks which feed `electron-updater` uses via [`src/main/updater.js`](../src/main/updater.js).

| Aspect       | Stable                                                           | Dev (`dev-latest`)                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workflow     | [`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml)                | [`dev-release.yml`](../.github/workflows/dev-release.yml)                                                |
| Trigger      | Push of a `v*` tag (tag must match `package.json` version)       | Every push to `master` (plus `workflow_dispatch`)                                                        |
| Build matrix | Linux + Windows + macOS                                          | Windows only (other rows commented out; re-enable to ship for more OSes)                                 |
| Release      | Normal GitHub release per tag; `v*-*` tags are marked prerelease | Single rolling `dev-latest` release, deleted and recreated each run so only one build is ever stored     |
| Versioning   | `X.Y.Z` from `package.json`                                      | CI rewrites `package.json` to `X.Y.(Z+1)-dev.<run_number>` before building (on-disk only, not committed) |
| Feed         | `provider: github` via the embedded `app-update.yml`             | `provider: generic` pointed at `.../releases/download/dev-latest/`                                       |

### Versioning and downgrade safety

Dev builds use `X.Y.(Z+1)-dev.<run_number>` so they sort strictly ahead of the current stable baseline but behind the eventual `X.Y.(Z+1)` stable — which cleanly promotes dev users onto that stable when it ships. Schema migrations are forward-only, so `allowDowngrade` stays false on both channels; switching Dev → Stable simply waits until stable catches up rather than rolling back.

### Dev uses `provider: generic`

`GitHubProvider` walks `releases.atom` in tag-lexicographic order and has prerelease-selection quirks that make a single rolling tag unreliable, so the dev channel uses `provider: generic` against a fixed URL. The `electron-builder` `publish` block stays the single source of truth — `updater.js` reads `owner`/`repo` from `autoUpdater.configOnDisk.value` rather than duplicating them.

### Channel switching at runtime

`updater:setChannel` persists the new value, reconfigures `setFeedURL`, and kicks off a background `checkForUpdates()` without awaiting it — the IPC returns immediately and no app restart is needed.

### macOS: custom install path (no Apple certificate)

Mac builds are ad-hoc signed (`identity: '-'`), and Squirrel.Mac — the native updater electron-updater delegates to on mac — validates the downloaded bundle against the running app's designated requirement, which an ad-hoc signature can never satisfy (ShipIt aborts with "code failed to satisfy specified code requirement(s)"). So on darwin electron-updater is used only for **check + download** (the zip is still sha512-verified against `latest-mac.yml`), and the install step is a custom bundle swap in [`src/main/mac-update.js`](../src/main/mac-update.js):

1. `autoInstallOnAppQuit` is forced off on mac — that flag is what hands the zip to Squirrel right after download (`MacUpdater.updateDownloaded`).
2. On `update-downloaded`, the zip is **staged**: extracted with `ditto -xk` (preserves framework symlinks), quarantine stripped defensively (`xattr -dr` — Node downloads don't set it anyway), and `updater:update-downloaded` is only broadcast once staging succeeds.
3. `updater:install` (or a normal quit, via a `will-quit` hook for `autoInstallOnAppQuit` parity) swaps the staged `.app` over the installed bundle with two `/bin/mv` renames — safe while running, macOS keeps the process's inodes alive — then relaunches. A failed second rename rolls the old bundle back.
4. Guard rails: refuses when not running from an `.app` or when Gatekeeper-translocated (`/AppTranslocation/` path), returning an actionable error instead of failing silently.

This mirrors what ShipIt itself (and Sparkle/Tauri/Velopack) does mechanically, minus the signature check we cannot satisfy — integrity still rests on GitHub HTTPS + the checksum, same trust model as the unsigned Windows/Linux channels. Updater failures anywhere (download, staging, install) are surfaced to the renderer via `updater:error` and shown as a toast; `updater:install` returns `{ ok, error? }`. The **first** install remains manual (browser-downloaded DMG is quarantined; release notes carry the one-time `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` instruction) — only subsequent updates are automatic.
