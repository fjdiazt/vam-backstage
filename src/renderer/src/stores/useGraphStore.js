/**
 * Graph view UI state persisted to localStorage. Low-stakes — if it resets the
 * user gets physics defaults and sees the experimental caution again.
 *
 * - `warningDismissed` — experimental-feature banner
 * - physics sliders (UI-facing friction: 1 = sticky; cosmos takes 1 - friction)
 *
 * Tuning philosophy (engine caveats live in DependencyGraphView.jsx): springs
 * define structure, repulsion only separates. If repulsion:linkSpring drifts
 * back above ~30:1 the layout anneals into a uniform hex-packed lattice where
 * topology stops mattering. Each slider's honest role:
 * - Repulsion: width of the voids between constellations. Side effect: it is
 *   also the "wind" that pushes leaf satellites leeward, so past ~150 you pay
 *   more in streamer stretching than you gain in spread.
 * - Link dist: orbit radius of private deps — the knob for "thumbnails feel
 *   packed", not repulsion.
 * - Link pull: global spring multiplier. Stability budget: per-link strength
 *   (up to ~11 for leaf links) × linkSpring × alpha must stay below ~1, so
 *   values past ~1.2 make dense areas vibrate and never settle.
 * - Cluster: constellation cohesion vs the cross-community links that try to
 *   merge everything back into one mass.
 * - Gravity/Center: stray containment only — both are harmonic traps that
 *   quietly re-form the central ball if raised.
