/*
 * Cosmos engine caveats:
 * - Every force is multiplied by alpha. At the ALPHA_FLOOR idle the sim runs
 *   at ~2% power: overlaps that "never resolve" are asleep, not broken.
 * - Springs are Hookean and attraction-only: rest length is a floor, pull
 *   grows with stretch forever while repulsion decays 1/r — so at long range
 *   any undamped link wins, which is what collapses a small-world graph into
 *   one ball. Structure lives in the per-link strengths, not the sliders.
 * - Stability budget: per-tick correction ≈ linkStrength × linkSpring × alpha.
 *   Past ~0.5 the sim turns into heated gas that never settles (we hit this
 *   at leaf strength 43 with alpha 0.02).
 * - 1/r repulsion is long-range: a big cluster blows a "wind" (~700·alpha
 *   measured here) on its surroundings. Leaves held by one spring stream
 *   leeward and bunch at the taut-leash point; out-stiffening the wind needs
 *   exactly the strength that crosses the stability budget, so pendant leaf
 *   fans facing away from the core are an engine limit, not a param bug.
 * - Gravity and the cluster force are harmonic traps (force ∝ distance):
 *   arbitrarily small coefficients still dominate at range. Keep gravity ~0;
 *   gate cluster strength to exactly 0 (not "small") for low-degree nodes.
 * - Collision is grid-cell-averaged, density-damped (×2/N neighbors) and
 *   per-tick capped: a soft spacing pressure, not contact resolution.
